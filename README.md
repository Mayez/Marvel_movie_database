The point of this code

            This mysql database is supposed create a MySQL database that stores all Marvel movies and users will 
            be able to query it. The table contains Foreign Keys and Primary Keys and tables connected due to these
            keys. The point of this code was to demonstrate my basic knowledge of MySQL and its basic concepts. Also,
            this was to get me more familiar with MySQL.
